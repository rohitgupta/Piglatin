 Pig Latin

A 1947 newspaper question and answer column describes the pig Latin as we understand it today. It describes moving the first letter to the end of a word and then adding "ay".
Word that begin with 'Consonent ' Sound , all letter before the initial vowel are placed at the end of vowel sequence and then 'ay' is added to it.
Eg: latin = atinlay
banana = ananabay

words that begin with vowel sounds one just adds "way" or "yay" to the end (or just "ay")
eat = eatay or eatway or eatyay

Pig Latin Awareness Month is the month of September.
Pig Latin Day is September 15.
